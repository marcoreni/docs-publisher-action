This action creates a documentation site with versioning on a specific branch.  
The target branch can then be used with Github Pages.

In order to use this action, you should have:

1. A command that creates the documentation in a specific, non changing path
2. (Optional) a CHANGELOG.md file

At the moment, this action can only be used with git tags, so your workflow should have:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags: 
    - 'v*'
```

## Inputs

### `deployment-branch`

The branch where you want to publish the documentation site. This is the branch
that will be used to host the GitHub Pages.  
NOTE: This branch will be used solely for this action. You cannot use an already existing branch, and
it's better to avoid messing with the branch.  
**Defaults to**: `gh-pages`

### `docs-command`

**Required** The command to be run inside the repository to create the docs. If using `lerna` strategy, you need to run
a command that will create documentation for all the packages. The action will take care of publishing only what's necessary.

### `docs-path`

**Required** The path where documentation will be found once docs are created. Path is relative to the root of the project.
When used with `lerna` strategy, you need to set only the subpath for the docs folder inside each of the packages.
The action will take care of the rest.

### `strategy`

The strategy to use to fetch the release details. Currently, `tag` and `lerna` are supported.

**Defaults to**: `tag`

#### Lerna strategy

When enabling this strategy, the script will generate documentation for every package available,
then it will look every package for an unpublished version and publish everything that is not already
published. This allows to run this action with `concurrency` + `cancel-in-progress` without issues.

### `versions-sorting`

The strategy to use to sort the versions in the list. Possible values:

- `semver-desc`: sorts by semver descending.
- `semver-asc`: sorts by semver ascending.
- `timestamp-desc`: sorts by release timestamp (based on the run that generated a specific build) descending.
- `timestamp-asc`: sorts by release timestamp (based on the run that generated a specific build) ascending.

**Defaults to**: `semver-desc`

### `enable-prereleases`

Split the versions list into two separate lists of releases and prereleases, using `semver`.

**Defaults to**: `false`

## Example usage

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '14'
- run: npm install
- uses: marcoreni/docs-publisher-action@v0
  with:
    deployment-branch: 'gh-pages'
    docs-command: 'npm run docs'
    docs-path: 'docs'
    versions-sorting: 'semver-desc'
```

## Development

There is no way to test the action locally, so you should have a repository where you run your tests.  

### Release a new version

1. Configure a `.env` file with the GITHUB_TOKEN variable. The PAT needs to have `repo` permissions on the Github Repo.
2. Run `pnpm run release`

## Recover function

The recover function will create the repo for already existing versioned docs.
Checkout an empty, orphan branch of your project repo (`git switch --orphan BRANCH_NAME`), then
create a `docs` folder and put your versioned folders in there.
Afterwards, run the command `ts-node src/recover.ts {PROJECT_REPO_DIR} {PROJECT_REPO_URL}` where

- `PROJECT_REPO_DIR` is the absolute path of the repository
- `PROJECT_REPO_URL` is the remote URL of the repository

The script will take care of generating the metadata.json file and the index.html file.

## TODO

- Support other version strategies (?)
- Create a version cleaner/archiver (version older than XXX are deleted / archived)
- Support `copy-changelog` parameter by putting the changelog inside the generated site
